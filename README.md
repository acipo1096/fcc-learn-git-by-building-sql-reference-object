A course part of freeCodeCamp's "Relational DB" certification. I've been using Git for a few years, and took a course in November 2022 on LinkedIn Learning. However, there were things I still wasn't clear about (as shown in my repositories). 

For example, rebasing, git history, and merging are basic concepts that I really didn't understand until taking this course. This course also drilled into my head that (1) you should never really touch main, and (2) introduced me to branch naming conventions
